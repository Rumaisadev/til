# What are class based components?
### Class-based components some IMPORTANT points
1) Class based components is an alternative to functional components.
2) Props doesnot work in funcional components so we must import component,instead of wriring props this is used with props as a keyword.
3) In class based components ,state must be defined within constructor and is always is in the object form and the property name is must state (this.state).
4) In class based you must have to define all the states in one object.And we can define nested objects,boolean values and arrays within this one state object
5) While using a constructor() you must have to call super constructor i.e super()
6) Can't use hooks in class based components.
7) For using context in class-componenets we use consumer approach instead of useContext hook.
