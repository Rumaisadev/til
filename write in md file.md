# heading
We can write heading in readme.md file by using #symbol in front of the heading for 1st heading **one #** is use 

similarly for second heading you should use **two ##** and so on.

if you want to **bold** some text you should use two steriks or two underscores before and after the text like ** ** or__ _ .
